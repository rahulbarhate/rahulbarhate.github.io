# IBM
### Intern - IBM Remote Global Mentoring Program (September 2018 - June 2019)

- Benchmarked the existing 3D machine learning techniques in use for object/scene regeneration and suggested the use of GANs as an alternative for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

# Tata Consultancy Sevices
### Systems Engineering Intern - (June 2018 - October 2018)

Project: Cloud Plus

- Prototyped a crude web-application for initiating video calls using AngularJS and WebRTC.

- Identified the key disadvantages of incumbent design, suggested the use of and set up the TURN server for initiating peer-to-peer communication when video call requests are blocked by firewalls. Tested the application on the thus setup TURN server.

- Programmed and maintained a script for encrypting the user credentials for initiating a secure connection.

- Designed an API that could consume the modules of video calling application along with existing services provided by TCS iON.

# Persistent Systems 
### Deep Learning Intern - (September 2017 - April 2018)

Project: Face Recognition, Emotion Analysis and Audio Annotation from Videos

Developed an end-to-end workflow for a content-based search engine that analyses the video-stream to extract and store essential features such as identity, emotion and objects in a frame. The metadata is processed to deliver search results based on user query.

Problems addressed during dataset formulation:

- viewpoint variation
- scale variation
- intra-class variation
- image deformation
- illumination conditions
- background clutter
