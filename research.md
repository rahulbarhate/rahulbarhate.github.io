### Generative Adversarial Networks as an Advancement in 2D to 3D Reconstruction Techniques

## 3rd International Conference on Data Management, Analytics and Innovation (ICDMAI-2019)

Abstract : Synthesizing three-dimensional objects from single or multiple two-dimensional
views has been a challenging task. To combat this, several techniques involving Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) have been proposed. Since its advent in 2014, there has been tremendous
amount of research done in the area of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Among the
various applications of GANs, image synthesis has shown great potential due to the power of
two deep neural networks - Generator and Discriminator, trained in a competitive way, which
are able to produce reasonably realistic images. Formulation of 3D-GANs - which are able to
generate three-dimensional objects from multiple two-dimensional views with impressive
accuracy have emerged as a promising solution to the aforementioned issue. This paper
provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning methods used in generating three
dimensional objects, reviews the different models and frameworks for three-dimensional object
generation, discusses some evaluation metrics and future research direction in using GANs as
an alternative for simultaneous localization and environment mapping as well as leveraging
the power of GANs to revolutionize the field of education and medicine.
