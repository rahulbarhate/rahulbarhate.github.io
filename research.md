### Computational Evaluation of Distributed Machine Learning Algorithms

**IEEE 5th International Conference for Convergence in Technology, Pune, India (I2CT, 2019)**

The paper focuses on the potential improvements in the existing AdaBoost algorithm.


### Generative Adversarial Networks as an Advancement in 2D to 3D Reconstruction Techniques

**3rd International Conference on Data Management, Analytics and Innovation, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia (ICDMAI, 2019)**

Abstract :  Among the various applications of GANs, image synthesis has shown great potential due to the power of
two deep neural networks - Generator and Discriminator, trained in a competitive way, which
are able to produce reasonably realistic images. Formulation of 3D-GANs - which are able to
generate three-dimensional objects from multiple two-dimensional views with impressive
accuracy have emerged as a promising solution to the aforementioned issue. This paper
provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning methods used in generating three
dimensional objects, reviews the different models and frameworks for three-dimensional object
generation, discusses some evaluation metrics and future research direction in using GANs as
an alternative for simultaneous localization and environment mapping.

### Analysis of Classifiers for Prediction of Type II Diabetes

**IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Communication, Control And Automation, Pune, India (ICCUBEA, 2018)**

Abstract : Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease and a
health challenge all over the world. As per the International
Diabetes Federation, 451 million people have diabetes
worldwide and this number is expected to rise up to 693 million
people by 2045. It has been shown that 80% of the
complications arising from type II diabetes can be prevented or
delayed by early identification of the people at risk. Diabetes is
difficult to diagnose in the early stages as its symptoms grow
subtly and gradually. Many of the cases involve the patient
being undiagnosed until they are admitted for a heart attack or
begin to lose their sight. This paper analyzes the different
classification algorithms based on a patientâ€™s health history to
aid doctors identify the presence as well as promote early
diagnosis and treatment. The experiments were conducted on
Pima Indian Diabetes data set. Various classifiers used include
K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine
and Neural network. Results demonstrate that Random
Forests performed well on the data set giving an accuracy of
79.7%.

### Performance Analysis of DML Operations on NoSQL Databases for Streaming Data

**IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Communication, Control And Automation, Pune, India (ICCUBEA, 2018)**

Abstract: The processing of streaming data has led to
major advancements in the fields of finance, security
analysis and social media analysis. For processing,
organizations must first store this data. Of the few data
storage options that satisfy the characteristics to reserve
streams of data, NoSQL databases provide a better
alternative because of their ability to stored schema-less
data which was not possible in RDBMS. Among these, two
databases in Elasticsearch and Cassandra have been
chosen to demonstrate their performance when tested
against a streaming application. The performance
comparison is carried out on the basis of Data
Manipulation Language operations on both NoSQL
datastores. Based on the experiment conducted, it is
concluded that higher scalability operations were
performed faster by Cassandra while Elasticsearch took
smaller execution time for applications that required
aggregations and modifications of data. The analysis done
thus helps organizations chose the appropriate NoSQL
Database for their own requirements.
