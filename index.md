#### Hello! Welcome to my page! :)

Hi, I am Rahul, a Computer Science graduate at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), New York. I graduated from [Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/), India with a Bacleors of Engineering majoring in Information Technology. 

I am immensely fascinated by the ground-breaking technologies used in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. I love to design solutions to complex and ambiguous engineering problems, especially when there are various layers and trade-offs to think through. Having eclectic experiences working at tech conglomerates like IBM, Tata Consultancy Services and Persistent Systems, I have hands-on experience in front-end development, backend systems, and data science. Overall, I am a generalist due to a solid background in computer science complemented with research experiences.

At NYU, I work/have worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the courses:
- **CS-GY: 6223: Introduction to Operating Systems** under [Prof. Kamen Yotov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyotov/) (Spring 2020, Fall 2021), 
- **CS-GY: 9223: Cloud Computing** under [Prof. Sambit Sahu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sambitsahu/) (Fall 2021), 
- **CS-GY: 6613: Artificial Intelligence** under [Prof. Pantelis Monogioudis](https://pantelis.github.io/) (Spring 2020).


I had been nominated by the Prime Minister's office to represent India at the Singapore-India Hackathon, 2018. My team finised as the 2nd Runner Up at this event being felicitated by the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi and the Education Minister of Singapore, Mr. Ong Ye Kung.

Apart from academics, I hold an interest in cricket, music and motorsports. I also enjoy learning about and experiencing new cultures. During my engineering days, I had the privilege of visiting Asian countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. I admire their cultures infinitely and make a dedicated effort to inculcate their best parts in my personality.
