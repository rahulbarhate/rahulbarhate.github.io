## Systems Engineering Intern - (June 2018 - October 2018)

Project: Cloud Plus

- Prototyped a crude web-application for initiating video calls using AngularJS and WebRTC.

- Identified the key disadvantages of incumbent design, suggested the use of and set up the TURN server for initiating peer-to-peer communication when video call requests are blocked by firewalls. Tested the application on the thus setup TURN server.

- Programmed and maintained a script for encrypting the user credentials for initiating a secure connection.

- Designed an API that could consume the modules of video calling application along with existing services provided by TCS iON.

## Deep Learning Intern - ()

Project: Face Recognition, Emotion Analysis and Audio Annotation from videos

Developed an end-to-end workflow for a video search engine that analyses the video/live-stream to extract and store important features such as identity, emotion and objects in a frame. Processing this metadata to deliver search results based on user query.
