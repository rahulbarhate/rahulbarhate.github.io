#### Hello! Welcome to my page! :)

Hi, I'm Rahul Barhate, a senior at Pune University, India majoring in Information Technology. I am immensely fascinated by the ground-breaking technologies used in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.

Apart from academics, I hold an interest in crikcet, music and motorsports. I also enjoy learning about and experiencing new cultures. Throughout my engineering journey, I had the privilege of visiting Southeast Asian countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. I admire their cultures infintely and make a dedicated effort to inculcate their best parts in my personality.
