Abstract :  Among the various applications of GANs, image synthesis has shown great potential due to the power of
two deep neural networks - Generator and Discriminator, trained in a competitive way, which
are able to produce reasonably realistic images. Formulation of 3D-GANs - which are able to
generate three-dimensional objects from multiple two-dimensional views with impressive
accuracy have emerged as a promising solution to the aforementioned issue. This paper
provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning methods used in generating three
dimensional objects, reviews the different models and frameworks for three-dimensional object
generation, discusses some evaluation metrics and future research direction in using GANs as
an alternative for simultaneous localization and environment mapping.
